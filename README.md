This repository contains PHP, HTML, CSS, and JS files, all working together to form the online ballot for general elections in Baustralia! This election is in the Year of Our Lord 2021, and in the 4th Year of Our Reign. It marks the end of the regnal year, moving on to 5 John 1. This specific version is based on the feel of Microsoft Neptune, and wordmark similar to Microsoft Windows 2000. The flag is based on Microsoft Neptune.

## Changelog

Build 68 - Base build. Using redesigned Microsoft Windows 9x theme.

Build 69 - Widescreen startup image (really only looks good in fullscreen mode), modified build string, about button removed from taskbar, using 'System 2' button. Added about info, starting on ballot. Windows are also movable now! Seperated CSS and JS into their own files.

Build 70 - Added Notes window for writing notes while reading. May come in handy for people who wish to study each other's speeches. Also, the startup window will detect if the user is on mobile or a PC. If the user is on mobile, they will get a Windows 9x-style blue-screen-of-death. Perhaps a Windows C.E. style system will be used instead. The ballot box is still unfinished.

Build 71 - Added clock in taskbar. Added form info. Moved index.htm to startup.htm. The index.htm was recreated to hold a full-width and full-height iframe so window url doesn't change as you navigate through the system. Updated about text too.
